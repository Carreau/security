About This Repository
=====================

This repository contains documents created as part of a
`Jupyter-Trusted CI engagement
<https://blog.trustedci.org/2021/08/engagement-with-jupyter.html>`_. The
intent is to survey existing Jupyter deployment documentation with a focus
on security-related instructions, and offer suggestions about improvements
that could be made to documentation.

There are 3 target use-cases:

* Single-user Jupyter Notebook/Server installlation
* Local multi-user Jupyter Hub installation for a laboratory environment
* Public multi-user Jupyter Hub installation with containerization (Docker /
  Kubernetes)
