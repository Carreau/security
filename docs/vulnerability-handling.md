# Jupyter Vulnerability Handling Process

This document summarizes and proposes guidelines for handling vulnerabilities reported in Jupyter projects. 

Security issues and vulnerabilities have expectations and processes that are differ from typical open source practices:
 - Private discussions
 - Obfuscation
 - Short timeline

This makes it quite hard to be able to understand, learn, or know what to expect from a security point of view. This document
will give you a glimpse on what's happening on the inside, and what timeline to expect when you report a security vulnerability. 
It will also serve as a guideline and task list for Jupyter Contributors and Developers on how to handle security relatied issues.

## Scope

This process applies to *all projects* governed by Jupyter, including JupyterLab, Jupyter Notebook, JupyterHub, and Jupyter Server.

## Reporting Vulnerabilities

If you believe youâ€™ve found a security vulnerability in a Jupyter project, please report it to security@ipython.org. If you prefer 
to encrypt your security reports, you can use [this PGP public key](https://jupyter.org/assets/ipython_security.asc). Project Jupyter 
will respond within 3 days to all new reports.

## Coordinated Disclosures

Project Jupyter follows a [coordinated disclosure](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Vulnerability_Disclosure_Cheat_Sheet.html#responsible-or-coordinated-disclosure)
model where the initial report and remediation are handled privately, but the completion description is made public once a patch
is available. Project Jupyter will disclose known vulnerabilities within 90 days by default, whether a patch is available or not.

## Acknowledgement

Project Jupyter will work to ensure that security researchers, developers, users, or others who identify and report vulnerabilities
within Project Jupyter software receive acknowledgement for their contribution. 

## Vulnerability Triage & Remediation Process

This section describes the process used by Project Jupyter to track, remediate, and disclose reported vulnerabilities. 
This description is both a reference for the Jupyter Community and a guideline for contributors.

### Roles

This process defines these roles:
- **Reporter** The individual(s) who report the vulnerability 
- **Coordinator** A Project Jupyter contributor who facilitates the tracking of the vulnerability through this process
- **Developer** One or more Project Jupyter developers who work on remediating the vulnerability

For the purpose of this document these roles are distinct, in practice, some of these roles may be handled by the same individual. However, the roles should be covered by a minimum of two separate individuals. For example, a Reporter may also fill the Developer role and create the remediation, in this case the Coordinator should be a separate individual.

### Process

The role responsible for each step is noted at the beginning.

- Upon receipt of the initial report:
  - **Coordinator**: Respond to the reported and acknowledge receipt of the report in the timeframe given in the "Reporting Vulnerabilities" section.
  - **Coordinator**: Open an issue in the private GitHub repository used for tracking vulnerabilities across projects
  - **Coordinator**: Assign the issue to one or more **Developers** to confirm the report
- If the vulnerability is not accepted:
  - **Coordinator**: Close the issue
  - **Coordinator**: Notify the reporter
- If the vulnerability is accepted, within the relevant repositories:
  - **Coordinator**: Open a draft [GitHub Security Advisory](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/repository-security-advisories/about-github-security-advisories-for-repositories#about-github-security-advisories)
    - Include relevant but sanitized details in the top level comment, which becomes public
    - Sensitive details and reproductions go in the comments on the draft advisory, which are not public
    - **Coordinator**: Add relevant people to the advisory - *note* we need an official list of GitHub handles here since teams don't work across orgs
    - **Developer**: Attempt to replicate the reported vulnerability. Request more information from the **Reporter** if necessary.
    - **Coordinator**: Request a [CVE](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/repository-security-advisories/about-github-security-advisories-for-repositories#cve-identification-numbers) from GitHub.  This is private until the advisory is published.
    - **Developer**: Work on the [vulnerability fix PR](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/repository-security-advisories/collaborating-in-a-temporary-private-fork-to-resolve-a-repository-security-vulnerability#creating-a-temporary-private-fork)
    - Once the fix is agreed upon, wait for the CVE number to be issued.
    - **Coordinator**: Notify the **Reporter** of the CVE number
    - **Developer & Coordinator**: Decide on release and announcement dates and post them the draft advisory.  These are typically at least a week apart to allow administrators to deploy fixes.
  - **Coordinator**: Post the release and announcement dates on the Jupyter Security [Mailing List]([security@ipython.org](mailto:security@ipython.org))
  - **Developer**: Merge the security fix PR
  - **Developer**: Make a release to PyPI and/or npm with no announcement or change log
  - **Coordinator**: Publish the security advisory on the announcement date.  GitHub will post the CVE to the MITRE database
- **Coordinator**: Notify the **Reporter** of the releases
- **Coordinator**: Close the issue in the tracking repository
