### Agenda + Minutes

Matthias:
- I won't be able to make it today, another meeting rescheduled at the last minute. 
- Figured out the process to get money from tidelift to numfocus, wrote to TL 10 days ago, waiting for reply, rewrote this morning ( I guess yestarday evening for you.)
- Nothing more, focusing on preparing SciPy on my end. Maybe BOF ? 

* Apologies: Rollin can't make it today (conflict)
