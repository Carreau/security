* Maybe use the JupyterCon room during the setup day for SSC/EC meeting.
* Joe Lucas will be driving, but will try to call in
* [TrustedCI Summit and Workshop in October 24-26](https://www.trustedci.org/2023-cybersecurity-summit) at LBNL
    * Recap:
        * Met w/Deputy Director of TrustedCI, Sean Peisert, on possibility to have Jupyter-related events at TrustedCI summit
            * First day is half-day, full day workshop/tutorial type things
            * Then main summit conent, 3 days
            * Then last day has more workshop type things
        * Time is good for for some kind of Jupyter security get-together
            * Suggested plan is something on
            * Reviving the Jupyter security training done at PEARC etc for first day
            * Then Jupyter security workshop on the last day
    * Having a story by the time of JupyterCon would be good
    * Enabling folks coming for Jupyter content maybe also to go to the TrustedCI summit itself
        * Contributions of travel/registration funding from other sources to enable this, e.g. Anaconda
        * Example: Zeek (intrusion detection) + Jupyter conversation, connecting Jupyter + security community
    * Do we have a way for people from either side to participate in the other?
    * Longer term topic, relationship is workshop/tutorials angle:
        * JupyterCon 2024
        * Expanding to 5 days, having workshops and tutorials as part of that?
            * This year it's 3 days because that's what we could get more.
            * Depends on budget outcome of 2023
    * For this JupyterCon (2023):
        * May be possible to have some space/time for talking security/building momentum for the TrustedCI
        * There's an existing tutorial room possibly on Wednesday for a day... could use that?
        * Yes for some structured discussion (more than a BoF, less than a tutorial/workshop)?
            * Have the security training in shape by then?
            * Seems tempting to Rick since he has such positive feedback from the Jupyter community
            * Rick favors Wednesday morning 2.5h
    * => Folks need to respond to the doodle poll (first dates as early as tomorrow or next week)
* An async update about bug bounty:
    * JupyterHub, JupyterLab, and Jupyter Server accepted
    * Jason to send email to those not accepted leting them know
    * Jason to send a scheduling email 
* Interaction with TideLift from Matthias
    * What TideLift brings us 
    * How money is handled
