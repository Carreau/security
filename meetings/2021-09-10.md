### Agenda + Minutes

* Meeting Expectations:
    * For discussion of general Jupyter + security topics
    * **NOT** for reporting or discussing specific vulnerabilities
    * Appropriate place for reporting vulnerabilities:
        * security@ipython.org
* Attendee Introductions
* Progress update on `jupyter.org/security` ?
    * https://github.com/jupyter/security/issues/1
    * Rick to finalize and create PR
* Trusted CI: Jupyter security documentation
    * Documentation census by Trusted CI, suggestions for docs
        * evolving doc from Kay presented by Terry
            * share via discourse as public but comment-only
        * note ipython-books is not officially supported docs
          => not clear to users sometimes what's official, what's not
        * reconciling security with accessibility/usability
        * github vs readthedocs docs disagree
    * How should security documentation be addressed going forward
        * Trusted CI suggests:
            * try taking existing docs and create a single one
            * color coded by status (exists, needed, etc)
            * as suggestion, could do something different (feedback)
        * Comments from Matthias,
            * better communication is desired in general
            * more proactive/public engagement for trust
        * Question from Rick:
            * Should the effort be about high level single doc, or
            * Better to focus at a lower level on a single project?
            * Matthias suggests focus on individual projects
            * Server level focus?
                * Lots of moving parts right now at that level
                * JupyterHub is where people may be most reactive
                    * JupyterHub vs other deployment alternatives?
                    * Percieved as less secure as alternatives "out of box?"
            * Single notebook server security docs may not have huge impact
            * For non-JupyterHub deployments, leave that external
                * Also legal/financial reasons to leave that out of Jupyter docs
        * Make it clear that notebook should NOT be connected to internet
            * You should at least put it behind nginx, etc
            * 
    * Integrating input from Trusted CI into security docs
* Other topics:
    * Potential other engagements under NumFocus for Trusted CI?

### Potential or Future Topics

* Updating blog post
* Core infrastructure badge project
* Trusted CI engagement
* Survey of Jupyter security documentation
* Community workshop plans for April/May 2022
* Credential management (Rick)
* Suggested by Matthias:
    * Recognition of people who have submitted actual CVE
    * Supply chain attack and credential management as part of the org
    * Raise Security specific funds that could be hold in a numfocus Security Specific Fund accounts
