- Meeting w/Intigriti
    - Customers
    - Researchers

- How is Intigriti interfacing with Jupyter ? 
    - 2 months ... trial period w/EC
    - Multiple programs, one from the EC. 
    - Would Jupyter be a good fit. 
    - What can be tested, will be tested will determine if we can be tested.
    - Sounds like issues identified external to their researchers they fund are not covered.
    - Cross communication between researchers
        - Would need to be a bit organized on putting CVE publications

- Post meeting
    - Rick's suggestion
        - Start small with a set of limited repos that are released
        - Communicates what key initial packages are 
    - Matthias suggests 
        - to scope even further to types of vulnerabilities and specific package
        - further more might be too vague
