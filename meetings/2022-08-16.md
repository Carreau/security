- 2FA progress
    - Proceeding OK
    - Minor issue with some cartoonist
    - Cal Poly interns
        - Brian OK with removing them
        - But he needs to do it to be sure who's intern
        - **Jason** is pinging Brian to do that
        - We could get a list and check across all orgs
    - **Matthias**: Tweeting about orgs that have 2FA turned on
      
- Aside: Should we get the Jupyter Twitter account verified?
    - Pain, requires fixing Wikipedia entries
    - There are more important things maybe
    - Aside++: Trademark problem with another Jupyter?
        - Matthias was talking to the Jupyter Trademark Committee
        - They should follow up with NumFocus probably

- OpenRefactory update
    - pypi.openrefactory.com
        - This has filtering, not everything
    - POC, scans ~100 repos from PyPI, some top projects
    - Collaboration done with OpenSSF
        - Alpha-Omega project
            - Critical OS repos to secure
            - Identifying partners (devs/vendors)
            - Will staff people to do mitigations
    - Developers have gone through some repos and filed bugs
    - Some are actual vulnerabilities in process of mitigation
    - Feedback, thinking about people with 10000 dependencies:
        - Don't want certain reports (volume)
        - Want only new vulnerabilities and issues
        - Scale is difficult
    - Sample project: Ansible (RedHat)
        - Identified ~200
        - Zeroed in on the most important ones w/OpenSSF
            - OpenSSF did the filtering: e.g. injection etc
            - 40 of interest
    - Next step
        - For Jupyter
            - Shared some initial reports
            - Want a more formal engagement
            - Want developers to use the product
            - How many repos?
            - Possible engagement models:
                - Integration/installation to pipelines for critical projects (would need triage), license in CI/CD pipelines
                - They could use one of their cloud machines, Jupyter devs could come run interactively on demand
                    - Would allow developers to see more issues than at pypi.openrefactory.com
                - Could be "jupyter.openrefactory.com", they do the scan and share results
    - Feedback from Jupyter sec:
        - Would like to try it on the most active repo
            - Get user and dev feedback from a lot of people
            - UI, feedback on false positives, etc
            - jupyter-server or JupyterHub?
        - Jason has notebooks that monitors activity across the project
        - OpenRefactory: Add JupyterHub to pypi.openrefactory.com
            - The page there is really good publicity and Jupyter depends on those other projects too
            - Suggest not to add another domain just for Jupyter
            - Ask JupyterHub developers to take a look and give feedback
            - Expand to other projects?
        - UI feedback, on each project's individual page:
            - When were the scans done?
            - What commit hash?
    - Milestone?
        - Get report out, try to fix some issues
        - Work together to publish (or dual publication) on Jupyter Blog about experience
        - Invite folks to sec meeting, point folks to OpenRefactory tool to try it

- Items for discussion outlined last time: 
    - Can we automatically crawl developer accounts for signs of inactivity
    - Reproducible package builds
    - Migrating to PyPI deploy tokens
        - Will be some coding 
        - Lots of assumptions like one user one password
    - Static analysis and source vulnerability scanning
