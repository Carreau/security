* Joe Lucas OOTO for this meeting. See you in Paris.
* https://docs.github.com/en/actions/deployment/security-hardening-your-deployments/about-security-hardening-with-openid-connect
* PyPI Organizations ([ticket](https://github.com/jupyter/security/issues/61))
    * Key: Delegation to subprojects and keeping subprojects from hitting barriers to prevent fracture?
    * 4 teams set up as 1 per GitHub org plus JupyterHub
    * Experiment, on JupyterLab made Federic an owner, moved hatch-jupyter under that
    * RBAC, OIDC could allow trusted publishers and bots go away
    * PyPI vs GitHub
        * Jupyter is subprojects in GitHub but not a perfect mapping
        * PyPI packages are tied to repos, not GitHub orgs
        * Flexibility in delegating who can manage releases, doesn't have to be SSC rep
        * New feature: PyPI products can be linked to GitHub on PyPI `/manage/project/{repo}/settings/publishing`
        * On GitHub required reviewers provide additional gating to publish
        * Yanking from PyPI?  Needs PyPI account?
    * Who should be top-level owners?  EC
        * May be a good choice for now until an official delegation
        * Q on asset inventory and privileged roles; is there an audit / sec team to be able to see into things?
            * Rick doesn't want that at the moment
    * Related: NPM provenance
* Security Subproject Update during SSC/EC meeting
    * Intigriti Bug Bounty
        * Vulnerability handling across projects
    * 2FA requirement
    * Security workshop
    * Auditing privileged access for Jupyter assets (github orgs/repos, pypi, DNS, etc. See notes from last time)
