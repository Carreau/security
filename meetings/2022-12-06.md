- Triage
    - Email list status?
        - https://github.com/jupyter/security/issues/50
        - Appears to be a permissions issue with the ipython-security mailing list not accepting external messages (from non-group members)
    - Issues
- Review request: https://github.com/jupyter/security/issues/49
    - Haven't done this review before, need to discuss process
- nbclassic (jupyter-notebook subproject)
    - Confirm w/developers
    - Respond to reporter
        - Above could be shortened by ensuring developers are looped into sec reports
    - Can we document guidelines about when we do backports/sec updates for existing releases vs telling people to wait for next major version
- Funding & Involvement
    - Onboarding newcomers interested in helping with security
        - What steps are there?
        - Maybe fleshing out the README with onboarding details would be a good idea

- Integriti
- PEARC23 CfP?
- Thought:
    - Subprojects should have a designated security contact
    - Designated security contact is subscribed to appropriate mailing lists, etc
