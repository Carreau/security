* Zeek has been experimenting with OpenSSF tooling (CI, static code analysis)
* Historically approached network monitoring by protocol
    * If you write the analyzer, you signature events
        * Script writer taps into these logs
    * People want to use this to identify applications
        * What would it look like for Jupyter? what's encrypted?
        * Could discuss / do during a working session:
            * installations
            * recorded network traffic
            * what visibility exists today?
                * what visibility could exist if there's further development?
* Jupyter should be able to build zeek instrumentation framework relatively independently
* Hackathon is feasible. 
    * If there's a range of familiarity with zeek, we could start with an "intro to zeek" talk leading into
    * "what could be built"
    * followed by "here's jupyter" (on the network)
    * into hackathon
* Will be more productive if there's "homework"
    * packet captures
* Instrumenting jupyter with agents may open up options
* Rick proposes:
    * Zeek and Jupyter each have their own separate, independent "full day" (maybe monday?)
    * but come together for a half-day collaboration on another day (maybe tuesday?)
    * James and Christian agree
* Christian will work with Rich on the join submission
* Submissions:
    * Full day from jupyter security workshop
    * Joint half day workshop from jupyter and zeek
    * Zeek (intro + advanced)
* Room capacity in the 50-80 people range
* Christian wants to see our threat model
