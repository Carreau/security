### Agenda + Minutes

- [jupyter/jupyter.github.io#696](https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter.github.io/pull/696)
- tidelift


Matthias : https://thestack.technology/10-point-open-source-software-security-mobilization-plan/


Matthias: Feedback from Yuvi: when opening a GHA, add a 2 line explanation that links to the Jupyter security process and that it may not be a valid security concern, especially since developers will see that being openend by a Jupyter Core Dev likely.

Rick: 
 - MFA for everyone.
Matthias: 
 - MFA part of ACS
Rick: 
 - Authorisation vs Authentication.


Jupyter Organisations within Security Scope require MFA. 
- Listing Orgs, 
    - https://github.com/jupyter/governance/blob/master/list_of_subprojects.md
- Listing Users, (who will be kicked if MFA enabled.)
- Services:
    - GitHub
    - BinderHub
    - Google
    - NPM
    - PyPI



There are many organisations that are not part of subprojects. 
    - Identify orgs, 
    - Identify which ones we (sec-group) do not have a access to (to open GHA/2FA)
    - For each GitHub org in scope, create list of members without MFA
    - Start 90 day clock
    - Notify non-MFA users

During the meeting we tried to list the Jupyter Orgs.

- List of orgs:
    - [Jupyter Lab](https://github.com/jupyterlab/)
    - [Jupyterhub](https://github.com/jupyterhub/)
    - [Voil√†](https://github.com/voila-dashboards/)
    - [Jupyter Server](https://github.com/jupyter-server/)
    - [Jupyter](https://github.com/jupyter/)
    - [Jupyter Widgets](https://github.com/jupyter-widgets/)
    - [jupyter-xeus](https://github.com/jupyter-xeus/)
    - [IPython](https://github.com/ipython/)

- Unclear:
  - [binder-examples](https://github.com/binder-examples)
  - [jupyter-attic](https://github.com/jupyter-attic)
  - [jupyter-incubator](https://github.com/jupyter-incubator)
  - [jupyter-resources](https://github.com/jupyter-resources)
  - [jupytercon](https://github.com/jupytercon)
  - [pickleshare](https://github.com/pickleshare)

Post metting notes: It looks like there organisations in GH have both "memebers" and "External colaborators", we might want to audit both.



- What is the scope of the security work? Project Jupyter Subprojects. What info do we need for each subproject (hopefully in their team compass info)?
  - Official orgs (or if not an org, what repos?
  - Official documentation publication & other websites
  - What are the published packages?
    - npm
    - pypi
    - conda-forge
  - What are the official services?
    - Binderhub
    - nbviewer

    - ipython.org
  - Social Media & other communication channels?
