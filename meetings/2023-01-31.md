* Bug bounty program questions for discussion
    * jupyterlab, jupyterlab-server and jupyter-server proposed so far w/contacts for each
    * Jason G. proposed to use the Github CVE process for reporting bugs. Is this the process that should be followed by the Intigriti Team/Bug reporters?
    * Is any one familiar with Intigriti?
* Should we have security.jupyter.org (or sec.jupyter.org)?
