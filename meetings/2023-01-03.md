- Vulnerability reporting
	- We've turned on public reporting of vulnerabilities in IPython and [Jupyter Security](https://github.com/jupyter/security/security/advisories/new)
	- Workflow is: person submits a report, an admin accepts the report and creates a "draft"
	- Reports are per-repo. It doesn't seem like there is a way to consolidate at the org level
	- It appears that only admin permissions can see the draft vuln reports
	- How to track reports?
		- We can have a single place where reports are done, so the security team can track it and open appropriate reports in subprojects
		- We can have a per-repo or per-subproject place to report, with a reporting structure in place between projects to track vulnerabilities
		- This process decision should be made at the SSC level in cooperation with other subprojects
		- Even if we have per-subproject reporting, we can have a catch-all reporting place in jupyter/security
- SSC formation
	- SSC reps are known at this point, and needs to self-organize at this point
	- EC meetings are on Monday. Perhaps the SSC members can be invited so we can all discuss how to launch these councils
