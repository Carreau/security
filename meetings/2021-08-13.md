### Agenda + Minutes

* Introductions
* Background
    * Security workshop in April/May 2022
    * Trusted CI engagement
    * Some goals/projects
        * [`jupyter.org/security`](https://github.com/rpwagner/jupyter.github.io/blob/master/security.md)
            * Elevate a new toplevel entry in the jupyter.org landing page for security
            * Inspiration is apache.org/security
            * Plan to start small and then have something to expand upon
            * Add the meeting to the security page
            * Questions for others on the call: *What do you want to see here?*
                * Makes sense to keep it concise
                * Most prevalent is vulnerabilities, but also server concerns
                * What are the top e.g. 10 concerns:
                    * Scope could expand a bit to explain what compromises can do
                    * People want to speak the same language around potential attacks
                    * Classifying attack vectors
                * "How can we help, not just protect but also detect?"
                * => Issue to start capturing ideas for attack vectors
                * Huge volume of potentially interacting traits to handle security
                    * Traits are distributed across different parts of the stack
                    * Hub things, notebook things, etc., and they interact
                    * If you don't turn 2 things on correctly you can think it's working but it's not
                    * Integrated management?  Where does that live?
                    * Rick really wants defaults that are secure already
                * How to keep different projects from being blocked?
                    * Concerns about getting telemetry into various parts of stack
                    * Gotta get it right early on, understand use cases early
                    * Hard to revert
                    * JEPs (https://github.com/jupyter/enhancement-proposals) may arise from security discussions (here)
                    * Telemetry use mostly for audit/reconstruction but also anomaly detection?
                    * Conflict between security/privacy
                * Coordinated release process that doesn't interfere with rapid release?
                * Consideration: Companies that may not normally interact with open source may engage more on security
                    * Some folks may have solved these issues internally
                    * Security engagement from that sector can be accelerated
                * Conflict in some contexts is between features and security
                    * Every minor thing can be deemed insecure in some way
                    * Balancing that negotiation between UX and sec is time consuming
                    * Example is realtime collaboration
                    * Tension between privacy / security
                * What information is gathered/not gathered can be bundled into security discussions, need to treat the data as something to secure also
                * Explaining to people what the purpose of telemetry is and how it protects usage helps people understand why it's being gathered
        * core infrastructure badge
        * documentation survey
* Discussion on how to use this meeting
    * Formalize this: Process, programmatic stuff, and organization
        * Vulnerability discussions should have another forum
        * Disclaimer at beginning of the meeting, cut off discussions about that here
            * Make this clear at the top of the agenda
            * Keep HackMD?
            * Be public about how the security process works
    * Standing item suggestions
    * Publicity level
        * Calendar
        * Discourse: 
            * perpetual thread like jupyter-server, open github issue and pin it
            * community call does different posts for each meeting
            * jupyterhub has the rtd page
            * can be a little more lightweight
        * Other project meetings
