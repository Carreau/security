### Agenda + Minutes

* Meeting Expectations:
    * For discussion of general Jupyter + security topics
    * **NOT** for reporting or discussing specific vulnerabilities
    * Appropriate place for reporting vulnerabilities:
        * security@ipython.org
* Attendee Introductions
* Documenting current vulnerability handling process
    * See: https://github.com/jupyter/security/issues/9
    * Rick will start a document for tracking
    * Draft that into something for on the security page
    * The mailing list needs tending
        * If an advisory is valid, typically open 24 hours
    * currently use github for security tracking
    * Having a checklist, similar to what Apache has
        * Outline the process
        * Notifications to make
        * Things to do to make a release
* Discuss current open issues, several are related
    * NumFocus discussion (NumFocus-wide security)
        * Start small, establish the email and recipients
        * Start redirecting traffic
        * tide lift?
            * need subscription to use that
            * higher cost than mailing list
            * maybe a bit more heavy handed
    * Communication again (#9)
        * Single consistent page, table of vulnerabilities?
        * Is there an easy way to know that something changed?
        * Compensate by having proactive ways for broad notification:
            * Update the central web page
            * Blog post written up, approved, published
            * Other things link to both of the above:
                * Twitter
                * Discourse
                * Mailing list(s)
            * Let people know that they can subscribe to the various options:
                * You can follow on Twitter
                * You can get the blog posts in your email
                * You can subscribe on Discourse (can subscribe to get emails)
                    * Can subscribe on per-topic. like `security` or `CVE`
                * GitHub
            * Say we will always communicate in these ways when that page is updated    
* Workshop status, maybe push toward end of 2022
* Somehow bacon

Discuss always adding Rollin and Rick to all Security advisories
