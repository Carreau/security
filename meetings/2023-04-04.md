* Workshop:
    * What do we want to get out of it?
        * Should we require best practices of other Jupyter subprojects
            * Would discussing this at the workshop be a good use of the opportunity?
            * Socialize and get feedback on this
            * Do the subprojects want guidance on this?
            * Dependency analysis vs actual issues with Jupyter code?
        * Logging and auditing w/Zeek?
            * What is there even for web HTTP/websockets applications?
            * Instrumentation at various levels of the stack
        * Different situations and their corresponding security best practices:
            * On my laptop
            * Dashboards (voila)
            * Multi-user w/JupyterHub etc
        * OWASP: https://owasp.org/
    * What is the calendar and schedule?
        * Summit Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, plenaries Wednesday
        * From the TrustedCI perspective, things still in flux, more content than previously thought
        * Possibility that we wind up on Friday, or Monday
