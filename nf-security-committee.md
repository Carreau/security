# Security Subcommittee for Numfocus

Typically, NumFOCUS and all its affiliated and sponsored projects are focused on
community and strive to communicate in public.

Security in contrast often requires private communication, and timely responses,
which is at odds with the typical open-source communication channels. Setting up
specific communication channels for each subproject can be costly for projects
in term of time invested for documentation and monitoring, especially for
subprojects. 

The multiple projects and different ways of inquiring about security can make it
hard for stakeholder to find how to contact the relevant projects; especially
when a question or vulnerability is related to multiple project interacting
together. 



We ask NumFOCUS board for the creation of a security subcommittee. 

- This subcommittee should have at least 5 members selected by the NF board. 
- This subcommittee should be reachable via security@numfocus.org. 

The following is expected from the member of this subgroup:

- to acknowledge security questions, concern or vulnerability in a short
  timeframe (maximum 1 week), and contact the relevant(s) subprojects, or
  subproject(s) maintainers.

- for a security vulnerability report: ensuring the reporter get a proper
  response. The response can be directly from the concerned subproject. The 
  security subcommittee can directly provide a response if:

    - The subcommittee members have sufficient expertise to provide a response 
    - The subprojects maintainers do not reply to inquiries – in which the
      matter should also be discussed with numfocus board.

- Ignore any non-security enquiries, warn and ban repeated offender from
  contacting security@numfocus.org as their discretion.
- Maintain a https://nufocus.org/security.txt text document following standard
  security practices (see https://securitytxt.org/)
- Maintain a more generic security webpage on https://numfocus.org with relevant
  information with respect to how to contact the
  subcommittee.
- Report regularly and privately to the NumFOCUS board to ensure objectives are
  reached.
 


The subcommittee members are not expected to have technical knowledge of the
NumFOCUS subprojects, though would they have sufficient expertise they may
decide to reply to a report/question and not forward to a subprojects. For
example reports of missing "X-Frame-Options" for static websites from automated
tools are often invalid, and do not need subproject involvements.

The subcommittee members are not expected to be proactive and act upon security
issue that are not directly reported to them.

The subcommittee is not expected to be able understand, fix, and request CVE for
issues, nor to respond to all security questions.

This subcommittee is not a replacement, nor preclude subproject having their own
security committee, work group, or contact channels for security related matter.

This subcommittee is not expected to directly work on improving security, or
defining security best practices.


We suggest the following 5 members for the initial subcommittee:

 - Volunteer 1 (affiliation, subproject if relevant), <email1@mail.com>
 - Volunteer 2 (affiliation, subproject if relevant), <email2@mail.com>
 - Volunteer 3 (affiliation, subproject if relevant), <email3@mail.com>
 - Volunteer 4 (affiliation, subproject if relevant), <email4@mail.com>
 - Volunteer 5 (affiliation, subproject if relevant), <email5@mail.com>


# Current project security process:

Many existing projects use tide lift, though this requires project maintainers
to be subscribed to tidelift – I'm not certain of all the implication.

- Numpy 
- PyMC3 
- Pandas
- SciPy
- Bokeh
- Dask

A few project s use custom mailing lists


- Julia : security@julialang.org.
- Matplotlib https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/blob/master/SECURITY.md
  matplotlib@numfocus.org
- Jupyter / IPython (security@ipython.org)


For the following I was not able to find how to contact.

- Stan ??
- Jump ??
- Pytables ??
- Sympy ??
- FEnics ??
- Conda-Forge
